Taint being a physical manifestation of that, twisting creatures into horrific monsters when left to its own devices.\nAnd while I couldn't fully parse the texts on warp... the incomprehensible notes and dark rituals that surround it definitely gives a bad first impression.\nI should get my own look at this \"flux\" myself.",

The two co-exist: modifying one modifies the other.\nThese aspects can also, apparently, be isolated, into solid-like, fluid-like, and gaseous-like forms: crystals are solid, and result from overflows of a particular aspect in the aura. The aura, in turn, is made up of the more gaseous vis form, and is almost entirely uniform, except around constant sources of aspects called nodes.\nFinally, equipment can supposedly be used to purify it into a fluid state known as essentia. Being much less stable than crystals, and much more concentrated than vis, essentia requires special measures to contain - though the notes were irritatingly vague on those.
